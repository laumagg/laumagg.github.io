# Choreographic Plant Room

### 03.2024 - 07.2024

Artistic Mixed Reality experience  \| HoloLens 2 

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, MRTK, Co-located Multiplayer

Choreographic Plant Room is a physical exploration of the digital flora of the South Pacific through dance and augmented reality glasses. The result is an interactive set-up in which live performance, the movement of the users in space and the movement of the digital objects are linked. What narratives are evoked by these imported botanical 3D snapshots evoke? What happens when we start to take their perspective?

The installation was presented as part of <a href ="https://www.institutfrancais.de/de/berlin/event/die-nacht-der-ideen-2024-berlin-25087#/" target="_blank">La Nuit des Idees</a> (the Night of Ideas) at the Institut Français Berlin on June 11, 2024. The convergence of physical and digital movement will be further explored in July in creative sessions with students from the Ernst Busch University of Theatre Arts Berlin.
