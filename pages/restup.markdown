# RestUp

### 10.2021 - 03.2022

Web app for selling industrial material scraps  \| Web 

**Technologies:** Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Django-Framework, SQLite

RestUp was a student project in collaboration with the start-up <a href="https://www.normcut.com/en" target="_blank">Normcut UG</a>. This company offers semi-finished products made from offcuts, i.e. from the residues of other industrial processes. In order to be able to recommend sustainable and suitable materials to their customers depending on their use case, an application should be developed that calculates the substitutability of materials based on their properties, a.k.a replaceability index. In this way, alternative materials can be suggested to customers for their use case. For this purpose, an ordering process was modeled and a prototypical web application was created.
