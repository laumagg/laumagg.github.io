# Transient exposure

### 2021.01. - 2021.09.

Artistic Mixed Reality installation  \| HoloLens 2 

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, MRTK

Transient Exposure was a Mixed Reality experience that combined physical artifacts, partially interactive digital augmentations and 3D sound to showcase archive material from the Chitrasena Dance Company (Colombo, Sri Lanka). This innovative approach aimed to provide visitors with a unique and engaging way to experience the rich history and cultural significance of the dance company. The installation was presented as part of the exhibition <a href ="https://codeandmateriality.fki.htw-berlin.de/de/startseite/">Extended Reality – Code and Materiality in Art and Culture</a> of the INKA research group, University of Applied Sciences Berlin.
