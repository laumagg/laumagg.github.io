<a href="https://www.jannenorakummer.de/leakingbody">XBPMMM</a> is an immersive multiplayer game that utilizes virtual reality (VR) and a specialized suit to merge players' physical bodies with the virtual experience. In this game, players assume the role of avatars that constantly transform throughout various levels. Through a combination of performative art, gameplay mechanics, body theories, and computational elements, XBPMMM aims to provoke self-awareness and introspection regarding one's own corporeal existence. It offers a unique perspective on body politics from a queer feminist lens, challenging established power structures and presenting alternative ways of perceiving, processing, and treating bodies. 

By incorporating breath sensors and actuators, XBPMMM establishes a connection between players' physical sensations and the virtual or real-world environments. This connection enables players to immerse themselves in the narrative and explore socially relevant issues on a more profound level, fostering a sense of agency and engagement.

**Artists:** Janne Kummer, Anton Krause, Steph Holl-Trieu, Philisha Kraatz, Codi KÃ¶rner & Johannes Aue
