# XBPMMM

## A Travelogue of Morphing Bodies

### 10.2021 - 01.2023 

An artistic and transgressive multiplayer VR experience \| Meta Quest 2 

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, XR Interaction Toolkit, MQTT, Mirror Networking


<a href="https://www.jannenorakummer.de/leakingbody">XBPMMM</a> is an immersive multiplayer game that utilizes virtual reality (VR) and a specialized suit to merge players' physical bodies with the virtual experience. In this game, players assume the role of avatars that constantly transform throughout various levels. Through a combination of performative art, gameplay mechanics, body theories, and computational elements, XBPMMM aims to provoke self-awareness and introspection regarding one's own corporeal existence. It offers a unique perspective on body politics from a queer feminist lens, challenging established power structures and presenting alternative ways of perceiving, processing, and treating bodies. 

By incorporating breath sensors and actuators, XBPMMM establishes a connection between players' physical sensations and the virtual or real-world environments. This connection enables players to immerse themselves in the narrative and explore socially relevant issues on a more profound level, fostering a sense of agency and engagement.

From January 19 to 22, 2023, the immersive experience was presented on a large stage at HAU - Hebbel am Ufer. It also could be experience at the <a href="https://2023.adaf.gr/portfolio-item/xbpmmm-a-travelogue-of-morphing-bodies/" target="_blank">Athens Digital Arts Festival (ADAF) 2023</a> in Greece.
