# Am Ende der Welt

### 09.2022 â€“ Now

Artistic multiplayer MR application \| Meta Quest 2, Pro 

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, FSM, Oculus Integration, Netcode

"The year is 2032, and interpersonal energy has become so bad worldwide that the entire system of existential energy threatens to reach an irretrievable tipping point.... Like islands, chaotic holes in space are opening up in ever different places and expanding until they occupy all of space."

Am Ende der Welt (At the end of the world) is a Mixed Reality (MR) art application that explores the boundaries of blending the virtual and real worlds in a co-located multiplayer setup. The Mini Opera utilizes cutting-edge VR technology to push the boundaries of possibility. With the monochromatic passthrough mode of the Meta Quest 2, it creates digital hybrid spaces where the lines between real and virtual become blurred, delivering an experience that goes beyond traditional notions of reality.
