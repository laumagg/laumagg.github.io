# Weaving Dreams

## Learning about Pua Kumbu

### 03.2023 â€“ DIKE 2023

AR game created at <a href ="https://asset.uts.edu.my/dike2023/" target="_blank">DIKE 2023</a> (03.03 - 12.03, Malaysia) \| Android

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, ARCore

The topic of the project was the art of Pua Kumbu weaving on Borneo island. Pua Kumbu are traditional cotton cloths used for sacred ceremonial purposes and healing rituals in the indigenous Iban community of Sarawak. Traditionally, the dyeing and weaving processes are subject to rules, prohibitions, and taboos that are closely connected to Iban beliefs. The patterns are considered sacred and represent the dreams of the master weaver.

The main concern of the Iban is that the Pua Kumbu patterns are now widely used for commercial purposes, while their traditions are being forgotten. Therefore, during the summer school, an AR app was developed to convey the traditions associated with this weaving art. A total of eight participants, two from the German University of Applied Sciences Berlin and six from different Malaysian universities, were involved in the conception and development of the app.

The aim of the project was to deliver general information about Pua Kumbu from the traditional weavers perspective. The target group comprised visitors and interested citizens from the age of eight without prior knowledge who are eager to learn about this weaving art in a modern and playful way.
