# Super Smash Trash

### 2024.01. - MIT Reality Hack

MR game created at the <a href ="https://www.mitrealityhack.com/" target="_blank">MIT Reality Hack 2024</a> (25.01 - 29.01, USA) \| Meta Quest 2 & 3 

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, Meta Presence Platform, ShapesXR

Super Smash Trash is a game built during the 2024 MIT Reality Hack. As part of the Living Harmony track, Super Smash Trash is designed to help people visualize the amount of waste they generate, and experience how seemingly minor decisions can compound over a great amount of people. Featuring a physical controller that mirrors the one used in gameplay, Super Smash Trash is an experience that is immersive physically as well as through visuals and audio.

Grab your trusty physical controller: a trash bag — and try to catch the trash falling from the heavens, before it hits the ground!

With each round, the trash increases by the amount of trash an additional person produces per day. How low can you survive in this infinite game mode?

You want to reduce the amount falling from the sky? Try to catch the power-ups— these are reusable products which can replace the disposable products and stop them from being added to the trash. Some amount of waste is inevitable, but by using reusable items whenever possible, we can greatly reduce the amount of trash we generate.
