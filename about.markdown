# Hi there, nice to meet you!  

### I'm Laura Amaro, a software developer passionate about digital hybrid realities. 

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Computer Science with a specialization in Visual Computing at the University of Applied Sciences Berlin. Previously, I completed a Bachelor's program in Environmental Computer Science, where I focused on web development and GIS.

I have cultivated a diverse skill set related to eXtended Reality (XR), including 3D computing using the Unity game engine, programming, and human-centered interaction. The convergence of technology, nature, and human experience fascinates me, and I strive to use technology to drive innovation and make a positive impact.
