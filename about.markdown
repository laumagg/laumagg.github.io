# Hi, I'm Laura, a software developer 
## with a passion for digital hybrid realities 

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in applied computer science at the University of Applied Sciences Berlin, focusing on Visual Computing. 

My skill set covers various areas related to eXtended Reality (XR), such as 3D computing, programming, data visualization, and human-centered interaction within cutting-edge digital realities. 
 
My interest also lies in digital art, social justice, and sustainable ways of life.
